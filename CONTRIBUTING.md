# Contributing to skills

Thank you for your interest in contributing to skills! This document provides Wix-specific guidelines for adding new skills to this repository.

> **Note:** For general Agent Skills format requirements, see the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/home).

## Adding New Skills

When adding new skills, follow these best practices:

### Folder Organization
 
**Best Practice: Add skills to folders according to the relevant product.**

Skills should be organized under the appropriate product directory structure. Currently, all Wix CLI skills are located under `wix-cli/skills/`.

#### Naming Convention

- Use the format: `{product-prefix}-{feature-name}`
- For Wix CLI skills, use the prefix: `wix-cli-`
- Use kebab-case for folder names

### Skill Documentation (SKILL.md)

Follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/home) for the base format.

## Questions?

If you're unsure about where to place a new skill or how to structure it, please:
- Review existing skills for patterns
- Open an issue to discuss the contribution
- Refer to the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/home) for format requirements
