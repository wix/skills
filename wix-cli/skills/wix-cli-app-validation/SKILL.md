# Wix App Validation

Validates Wix CLI applications through a five-step sequential workflow: TypeScript compilation check, package installation, build, preview, and e2e testing.

## Non-Matching Intents

Do NOT use this skill for:

- **Creating new extensions** → Use `wix-cli-dashboard-page`, `wix-cli-embedded-script`, etc.
- **Deploying to production** → This is for validation/testing only
- **Unit testing** → This skill performs e2e/integration testing

## Validation Workflow

Execute these steps sequentially. Stop and report errors if any step fails.

### Step 1: TypeScript Compilation Check

Run TypeScript compiler to check for type errors before proceeding with any other steps:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```

**Success criteria:**
- Exit code 0
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- All type checks pass

**On failure:** Report the specific TypeScript errors and stop validation. Common issues:
- Type mismatches between expected and actual types
- Missing type declarations for imported modules
- Incorrect generic type parameters
- Properties not existing on declared types
- Incompatible function signatures

**Example error output:**
```
src/dashboard/pages/offers/page.tsx:45:23 - error TS2339: Property 'id' does not exist on type 'undefined'.
src/components/OfferForm.tsx:12:5 - error TS2322: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
```

### Step 2: Package Installation

Ensure all dependencies are installed before proceeding with the build.

**Detect package manager:**
- Check for `package-lock.json` → use `npm`
- Check for `yarn.lock` → use `yarn`
- Check for `pnpm-lock.yaml` → use `pnpm`
- Default to `npm` if no lock file is found

**Run installation command:**

```bash
# For npm
npm install

# For yarn
yarn install

# For pnpm
pnpm install
```

**Success criteria:**
- Exit code 0
- All dependencies installed successfully
- No missing peer dependencies warnings (unless expected)
- `node_modules` directory exists and contains expected packages

**On failure:** Report the installation errors and stop validation. Common issues:
- Network connectivity problems
- Corrupted lock files
- Version conflicts
- Missing Node.js or package manager

### Step 3: Build Validation

Run the build command and check for compilation errors:

```bash
npx wix build
```

**Success criteria:**
- Exit code 0
- No TypeScript errors
- No missing dependencies

**On failure:** Report the specific compilation errors and stop validation.

### Step 4: Preview Deployment

Start the preview server:

```bash
npx wix preview
```

**Success criteria:**
- Preview server starts successfully
- Preview URLs are generated (both site and dashboard)

**URL extraction:** Parse the terminal output to find both preview URLs. Look for patterns like:
- Site preview: `Site preview: https://...` or `Site URL: https://...`
- Dashboard preview: `Dashboard preview: https://...` or `Preview URL: https://...` or `Your app is available at: https://...`

Extract both URLs as they will be used in Step 5 for testing.

**On failure:** Report the preview startup errors and stop validation.

### Step 5: E2E Testing with Playwright MCP

Once the preview URL is available, use Playwright MCP tools to validate the application.

See [Playwright MCP Reference](references/PLAYWRIGHT_MCP.md) for complete tool documentation.

#### Pre-Flight Checklist

Before starting Playwright testing, create a test plan for each dashboard page extension:

**For each dashboard page extension, identify:**
1. **Primary user action**: What's the main button/action? (e.g., "Create Offer", "New Item", "Save")
2. **Secondary actions**: What other interactive elements exist? (filters, tabs, edit buttons)
3. **Empty states**: What buttons appear when no data exists?
4. **Form fields**: What inputs need testing?

**Create a mental testing checklist for each page:**
- [ ] Page loads without app-specific errors
- [ ] Primary action button exists and is clickable
- [ ] Console remains clean after button click
- [ ] No backend 5xx errors from YOUR app's APIs
- [ ] UI responds correctly to interaction

#### 5.1 Test Site Preview and All Extensions

Test both the site preview and all dashboard page extensions. Parse the preview output to identify:
- **Site preview URL**: The main site URL (typically shown as "Site preview" or similar)
- **Dashboard preview URL**: The base URL for dashboard pages

**A. Test Site Preview**

1. **Navigate to the site preview URL:**
   ```
   Tool: playwright__browser-navigate
   Args: { "url": "<site-preview-url>" }
   ```

2. **Wait for the page to load completely** before proceeding to validation steps (4.2-4.7).

3. **Run validation steps 5.2-5.7** to validate the site preview.

**B. Test All Dashboard Page Extensions**

Discover all dashboard page extensions from `src/extensions.ts` and test each one. For each extension:

1. **Navigate to the extension URL:**
   - Base dashboard preview URL: `<dashboard-preview-url>`
   - Extension routePath: from `routePath` property in each extension definition
   - Full URL: `<dashboard-preview-url>/<routePath>`
   - Example: If dashboard preview URL is `https://preview.wix.com/...` and routePath is `"offers"`, navigate to `https://preview.wix.com/.../offers`

   ```
   Tool: playwright__browser-navigate
   Args: { "url": "<dashboard-preview-url>/<routePath>" }
   ```

2. **Wait for the page to load completely** before proceeding to validation steps (5.2-5.7).

3. **Run validation steps 5.2-5.7** for each extension to ensure all dashboard pages are validated.

**Common dashboard page extensions to test:**
- Root page (routePath: `""` or `"/"`)
- Dashboard pages with any routePath value
- Nested routes with multiple path segments

**Note:** Only test dashboard page extensions (`extensions.dashboardPage`). Skip data extensions and embedded scripts for this validation step.

#### 5.2 Check for Runtime Errors

Check console errors at **THREE** critical moments:
1. **On initial page load** (wait 3-5 seconds for page to settle)
2. **After EACH button click or interaction**
3. **After any navigation or tab change**

```
Tool: playwright__browser-console-messages
Args: { "level": "error" }
```

**Distinguish between error types:**

✗ **CRITICAL - App Errors (FAIL validation):**
- Errors with stack traces pointing to YOUR source code
- Paths include: `/src/`, `/dashboard/`, `/extensions/`, your component files
- Example: `TypeError at /src/dashboard/pages/offers/page.tsx:45`
- Example: `ReferenceError: variable is not defined at components/OfferForm.tsx`

✓ **OK - Third-party Warnings:**
- Google Maps async loading warnings
- react-i18next warnings
- Sentry initialization logs

**Action on errors:**
- If CRITICAL app errors found → Mark page validation as **FAILED**
- Document all errors in the validation report with full messages

#### 5.3 Validate Backend API Calls

Check that all backend API calls are successful and not returning error status codes.

```
Tool: playwright__browser-network-requests
Args: {}
```

**Validate API responses:**
- Check all network requests for status codes
- **Critical failures:** Any 500 (Internal Server Error) responses from backend APIs
- **Warning:** 4xx responses (client errors) - note but may be expected in some cases
- **Success:** 200-299 status codes are acceptable
- Filter requests to only check API endpoints (typically `/api/` or backend service URLs)

**Check for:**
- No 500 errors from backend APIs
- No 502 (Bad Gateway) or 503 (Service Unavailable) errors
- Failed requests to Wix backend services
- Timeout errors on API calls

**On failure:** Report:
- Which API endpoint(s) failed
- HTTP status code(s) received
- Request URL and method
- Response body if available (may contain error details)

**Note:** This validation should be performed after the page has fully loaded and all API calls have completed. Wait for network activity to settle before checking.

#### 5.4 Interactive Testing

**CRITICAL**: Pages may load successfully but fail when users interact with them. You **MUST** test primary actions on every page.

**⚠️ VALIDATION REQUIREMENT**: Do NOT mark any page as validated until you have clicked at least one primary action button and verified no app errors occurred.

---

**For EACH dashboard page, perform these steps:**

**Step 1: Identify Interactive Elements**

Capture an accessibility snapshot to identify buttons and interactive elements:

```
Tool: playwright__browser-snapshot
Args: {}
```

**Step 2: Test Primary Action Button**

You **MUST** click at least one primary action button on each page:

```
Tool: playwright__browser-click
Args: { "element": "Primary action button name", "ref": "element-ref-from-snapshot" }
```

**Step 3: Check Console Errors After EACH Click**

Immediately after clicking, check for errors:

```
Tool: playwright__browser-wait-for
Args: { "time": 2 }  # Wait for action to complete

Tool: playwright__browser-console-messages
Args: { "level": "error" }
```

**Analyze the errors:**
- ✗ **App errors** (from YOUR code) → **FAIL** the page validation
- ⚠️ Platform errors → Note but continue
- ✓ No errors → **PASS**

**Step 4: Test Additional Interactions**

**Form inputs:**
```
Tool: playwright__browser-type
Args: { "element": "Input field", "ref": "input-ref", "text": "test value" }
```

**Navigation flows:**
- Click list items to navigate to detail views
- Click tabs to switch between sections
- Test back navigation

**Step 5: Document Results**

For each interaction tested, document:
- ✓ Button: "[Button Name]" - Clicked successfully, no errors
- ✗ Button: "[Button Name]" - ERROR: [full error message with stack trace]
- ⚠️ Button: "[Button Name]" - Warning: [platform error message]

---

**Success criteria:**
- At least ONE primary action button clicked per page
- Console checked for errors after EACH click
- No app-specific errors found (platform errors are OK)
- Results documented for validation report

**Failure criteria:**
- Primary action button not tested
- App errors found after button click
- Errors not checked after interaction

**On failure:** Report:
- Page name and route
- Button that was clicked
- Full error message from console
- Stack trace showing source file
- Mark validation as FAILED for that page

#### 5.5 Capture Accessibility Snapshot

```
Tool: playwright__browser-snapshot
Args: {}
```

**Validate:**
- Expected UI elements are present
- Page structure is correct
- No broken or missing components

#### 5.6 Take Screenshot (Optional)

```
Tool: playwright__browser-take-screenshot
Args: { "fullPage": true }
```

Capture visual evidence of the rendered page state.

#### 5.7 Execute Custom Validations (If Needed)

```
Tool: playwright__browser-evaluate
Args: { "function": "() => { /* validation code */ }" }
```

Use for custom runtime checks like:
- Verifying specific DOM elements exist
- Checking application state
- Validating data loading
