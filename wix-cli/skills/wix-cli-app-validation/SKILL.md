# Wix App Validation

Validates Wix CLI applications through a four-step sequential workflow: package installation, TypeScript compilation check, build, and preview.

## Validation Workflow

Execute these steps sequentially. Stop and report errors if any step fails.

### Step 1: Package Installation

Ensure all dependencies are installed before proceeding with the build.

**Detect package manager:**
- Check for `package-lock.json` → use `npm`
- Check for `yarn.lock` → use `yarn`
- Check for `pnpm-lock.yaml` → use `pnpm`
- Default to `npm` if no lock file is found

**Run installation command:**

```bash
# For npm
npm install

# For yarn
yarn install

# For pnpm
pnpm install
```

**Success criteria:**
- Exit code 0
- All dependencies installed successfully
- No missing peer dependencies warnings (unless expected)
- `node_modules` directory exists and contains expected packages

**On failure:** Report the installation errors and stop validation. Common issues:
- Network connectivity problems
- Corrupted lock files
- Version conflicts
- Missing Node.js or package manager

### Step 2: TypeScript Compilation Check

Run TypeScript compiler to check for type errors.

**Full project check:**
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```

**Targeted check (specific files/directories):**

When validating after implementing a specific extension, you can run TypeScript checks on just those files:

```bash
# Check specific directory
npx tsc --noEmit src/extensions/dashboard/pages/survey/**/*.ts src/extensions/dashboard/pages/survey/**/*.tsx

# Check dashboard pages only
npx tsc --noEmit src/extensions/dashboard/pages/**/*.ts src/extensions/dashboard/pages/**/*.tsx

# Check site widgets only
npx tsc --noEmit src/site/widgets/**/*.ts src/site/widgets/**/*.tsx

# Check dashboard modals only
npx tsc --noEmit src/extensions/dashboard/modals/**/*.ts src/extensions/dashboard/modals/**/*.tsx

# Check backend only
npx tsc --noEmit src/backend/**/*.ts
```

**When to use targeted checks:**
- After implementing a single extension (faster feedback)
- When debugging type errors in a specific area
- During iterative development

**When to use full project check:**
- Before final validation
- When changes affect shared types
- Before building/deploying

**Success criteria:**
- Exit code 0
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- All type checks pass

**On failure:** Report the specific TypeScript errors and stop validation. Common issues:
- Type mismatches between expected and actual types
- Missing type declarations for imported modules
- Incorrect generic type parameters
- Properties not existing on declared types
- Incompatible function signatures

### Step 3: Build Validation

Run the build command and check for compilation errors:

```bash
npx wix build
```

**Success criteria:**
- Exit code 0
- No TypeScript errors
- No missing dependencies

**On failure:** Report the specific compilation errors and stop validation.

### Step 4: Preview Deployment

Start the preview server:

```bash
npx wix preview
```

**Success criteria:**
- Preview server starts successfully
- Preview URLs are generated (both site and dashboard)

**URL extraction:** Parse the terminal output to find both preview URLs. Look for patterns like:
- Site preview: `Site preview: https://...` or `Site URL: https://...`
- Dashboard preview: `Dashboard preview: https://...` or `Preview URL: https://...` or `Your app is available at: https://...`

Extract both URLs and provide them to the user for manual verification.

**On failure:** Report the preview startup errors and stop validation.

## Validation Report

After completing all steps, provide a summary:

**Pass:**
- Dependencies: ✓ All packages installed successfully
- TypeScript: ✓ No compilation errors
- Build: ✓ Compiled successfully
- Preview: ✓ Running at [URL]

**Fail:**
- Identify which step failed
- Provide specific error messages
- Suggest remediation steps

## Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Package installation fails | Missing lock file, network issues, or corrupted node_modules | Delete `node_modules` and lock file, then reinstall |
| TypeScript compilation fails | Type mismatches, missing declarations, or incorrect types | Fix TypeScript errors shown in `npx tsc --noEmit` output |
| Build fails with TS errors | Type mismatches | Fix TypeScript errors in source |
| Preview fails to start | Port conflict or config issue | Check `wix.config.json` |
| Console errors in preview | Runtime exceptions | Check browser console output |
| UI not rendering | Component errors | Review component code and imports |
