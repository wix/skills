- **Entity management** — Creating, updating, and deleting products, services, staff members, pricing plans
- **Administrative operations** — Bulk updates, contact labeling, data migrations
- **Backend integrations** — Server-to-server automations, webhooks, data synchronization

These recipes do NOT cover frontend development or SDK usage for displaying data to users.
